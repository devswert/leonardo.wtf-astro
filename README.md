# Â¿Un Portfolio?

This is a small portfolio written to host a beautiful version of my cv, and in a near future write or publish notes/posts about what I'm learning. In a tech summary, this project was built with:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/): A content-driven framework.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS framework to create beautiful UIs.
- [Blobs](https://blobs.dev/): Used to generate random SVG shapes used as ClipPath with images.
- [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/): Used to have smooth animations between shape transitions.

[Blobs Generator app](https://lokesh-coder.github.io/blobs.app/) was an inspiration to build the BurbleShape component.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
